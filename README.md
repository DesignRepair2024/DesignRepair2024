## setup envs
<!-- conda create --name fkmd python=3.11
conda activate fkmd
pip install -r requirements.txt -->
Run the backend (I use Poetry for package management - `pip install poetry` if you don't have it):

```bash
cd backend
poetry install
poetry shell
poetry run uvicorn main:app --reload --port 7001
```

## 2 add openai key and ROOT_DIR
create file ".envs"
OPENAI_API_KEY="keyhere"
